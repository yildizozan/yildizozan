### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a ardent engineer who 5+ years of experience specializing in full-stack development, DevOps, container orchestration, infrastructure automation, and computer hacking/security. A super nerd who loves Containers, Kubernetes, Golang, Rust, Vim, Linux(especially Debian) and OS X and enjoys customizing all of the development environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises. I love working with enthusiastic people on projects that matter, solve problems, learn and discuss interesting topics and share know-how.
